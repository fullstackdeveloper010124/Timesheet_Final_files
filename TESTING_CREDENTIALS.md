# Testing Credentials for Employee Dashboard

## Available Team Members in Database

Based on the API response, here are the valid team members you can use for testing:

### 1. Solomon Bridges (Recommended)
- **Email**: `imran@imran.com`
- **Employee ID**: `EMP1758561262557`
- **Shift**: `Hourly`
- **Project**: Available in database

### 2. IMRAN
- **Email**: `imran@test.com`
- **Employee ID**: Available in database
- **Shift**: Available in database

### 3. Buckminster Salinas (Admin)
- **Email**: `admin@email.com`
- **Employee ID**: Available in database
- **Shift**: Available in database

## How to Test

1. **Go to Login Page**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/login`

2. **Use Valid Credentials**: 
   - Email: `imran@imran.com` (recommended)
   - Password: (your actual password)
   - Role: Select "Employee"

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   ```
   ✅ Login successful
   ✅ Token stored in localStorage
   ✅ User authenticated via API
   ✅ Team member data found and loaded
   ✅ Dashboard loads with proper data
   ✅ No API errors
   ```

## Current Issue

The problem you're experiencing is that you're authenticated as:
- **User**: "Admin User" 
- **Email**: "admin@example.com"
- **ID**: "temp-admin-123"

But there's **no matching team member** in the database with email "admin@example.com".

## Solution

**Option 1: Use Existing Team Member**
Login with `imran@imran.com` instead of the admin account.

**Option 2: Add Admin to Team Members**
Add a team member record with email "admin@example.com" to match your admin user.

## API-Only Data Confirmed ✅

All localStorage dependencies have been removed:
- ✅ Dashboard.tsx - Uses AuthContext only
- ✅ Timesheets.tsx - Removed localStorage user data
- ✅ LeaveApplication.tsx - Uses AuthContext only
- ✅ All data now comes from API calls
- ✅ Only authentication token stored in localStorage
